//expected approach it is better than naive approach beacuse if n is larger than naive approach will give a worst case and also if we have the k smallest than we can get a better output using min-heap
//min heap is basically a proirityQueue where the smallest element placed at top we have various methods such as peek(), poll(),add().

class Solution{
public int kthsmallest(int[] arr, int k){
  PriorityQueue<Integer> pq=new PriorityQueue<>(Collections.reverseOrder());
        for(int val:arr){
            pq.add(val);
            if(pq.size()>k){
                pq.poll();
            }
        }
        return pq.peek();
        
    }
    }

    ## TC-O(nlogk) for a min heap it takes O(logk) for add operation
    ## SC- O(n)  heap size
